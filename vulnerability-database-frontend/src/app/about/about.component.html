        Google, founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998, is the world’s
    largest search engine with its 92% market share. Google offers more
    than 50 services such as Gmail, Chrome, and the Google Cloud Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of Google’s many services is Android, an operating system designed
    for mobile devices. Every year, hundreds of security vulnerabilities
    are remediated on over three billion Android devices. Google’s Android
    Security Bulletin communicates information on vulnerabilities to Google’s
    partners and is matched to reports in the National Vulnerability Database
    (NVD). These data sets are critical to security experts, but additional
    effort is required to collect and combine the data from both sources.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Android Vulnerability Database consolidates information from
    the bulletins and data from the NVD in one place and enables users
    to access that information via the web.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our tool illustrates metrics that are found in the databases in an
    attractive, easy-to-use format so experts can survey vulnerabilities
    with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most important metric is the base score which indicates the overall
    severity of the vulnerability and helps security experts to prioritize
    certain vulnerabilities as they develop fixes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Security experts can access the consolidated data set via the web-facing
    application. They can retrieve information with prepared requests
    or tailor their requests to suit their specific needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The app also visualizes the data for users, helping them to analyze
    the information in an intuitive way, enabling Google employees to
    solve Android vulnerabilities easier than ever before.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our tool is open source, hosted on Google Cloud Platform, and utilizes
    ETL methodology to manage the data. API calls are then used to retrieve
    data from cloud SQL databases.
